# Atlassian Connect Polyfill

The Atlassian Connect Polyfill companion app aims to provide support for Connect apps on the Atlassian Server/Data Center platform.

## What it does

The purpose of this app is to help Atlassian app developers to remove any friction when developing apps for both
Server/Data Center as well as Cloud (using Atlassian Connect).

One of the key architectural features of Atlassian Connect is that apps run within a sandboxed iframe and communicate
with the host application using the Atlassian Javascript API (AP).

Running the app in an iframe also brings a lot of benefits to the Atlassian Server/Data Center platform. It avoids
common issues with 3rd party dependency collision, where the host application or other app developers introduce
popular libraries such as React or jQuery that are available on the global variable scope. This can override 
other versions which may introduce issues. When the app runs in an iframe, there is no shared code between the app
and the host application.

In addition, with the Atlassian Connect Polyfill, front-end developers can use the same AP methods in Cloud as well
as Server/Data Center environment, removing the requirement to detect platform and write platform specific code.

This should make developing apps for both Cloud and Server/Data Center easier, more maintainable and hopefully
reduce errors.

This package is the "back-end" part and relies heavily on the "front-end" part that is in the `@collabsoft-net/connect` package. See https://github.com/collabsoft-net/iapetus/tree/main/packages/connect

## Compatibility matrix

Atlassian has been publishing breaking changes between Platform 6 (Jira 9, Confluence 8, Bamboo 9 and Bitbucket 8) and 
Platform 7 (Jira 10, Confluence 9, Bamboo 10 and Bitbucket 9), and has already announced that Platform 8 will also include breaking changes.

This compatibility matrix will show you which versions of IApetus can be used with specific versions of the host product.

| Version | Jira           | Confluence    | Bamboo         | Bitbucket      |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 2.0.0   | 9.0.0 - 10.4.x | 8.0.0 - 9.3.x | 9.0.0 - 10.2.x | 8.0.0 - 9.5.x  |
| 1.6.2   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.6.1   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.6.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.5.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.4.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.3.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.2.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.1.0   | -              | -             | -              | -              |
| 1.0.0   | 9.0.0 - 9.17.x | 8.0.0 - 8.9.x | 9.0.0 - 9.6.x  | 8.0.x - 8.19.x |

_The last verified version range will continue to apply until otherwise specified_

N.B. Host product versions are not continuously tested, which means that _latest_ might not mean the actual latest version. 
It means that it is expected to work up until the latest version unless otherwise specified.

## How it works

When installed, the app registers a servlet that listens to `/plugins/servlet/atlassian-connect/{appKey}/{moduleKey}`.
This is similar to the Atlassian servlet that runs on Cloud (`/plugins/servlet/ac`).

It will use the provided `{appKey}` and `{moduleKey}` to retrieve the module parameters from the `atlassian-plugin.xml`.
These parameters are used to generate an iframe that will load the app front-end code.

In addition, it also provides a `all.js` similar to that of Atlassian Connect, which is an Atlassian Javascript API (AP) polyfill. This will interact with the host application in the same way that you can interact with the host product in Cloud.

## Getting started

In order to use this companion app, there are a lot of different steps that you will need to take:

1. Switch to publishing an OBR instead of a single JAR
2. Generate a WRM context with the client-side "host" application
3. Create a servlet that will serve your HTML
4. Adjust your `atlassian-plugin.xml` to start using the polyfill
5. Add support for licensing (optional)
6. Add platform specific code (optional)

In addition to this guide, there are also example apps in this repository (in the `examples` directory) for each of the supported Atlassian host products.

### Switch to publishing an OBR instead of a single JAR

If you're not familiar with OBR, you can [read more about it here](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/bundling-extra-dependencies-in-an-obr/).

Here are the specific steps to add the Atlassian Connect polyfill as a dependency to your app:

#### Add the Collabsoft Maven repository to your POM

The Atlassian Connect Polyfill is not published on the Maven Central repository.
Instead it is pushed to our own public Maven repository. In order to use it,
you will need to add our repository to your `pom.xml`.

```
<repositories>
  ...
  <repository>
    <id>CollabSoft Maven Repository</id>
    <name>CollabSoft Maven Repository</name>
    <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
    <url>http://repository.collabsoft.net/releases</url>
  </repository>
  ...
</repositories>
```

#### Add the package as a provided dependency

```
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

#### Add Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite (AMPS) specific instructions

In order for the plugin to be included in the OBR, we need to
add the following to the `jira-maven-plugin` or `confluence-maven-plugin`:

```
<plugins>
  ...
  <plugin>
    <groupId>com.atlassian.maven.plugins</groupId>
    ...
    <configuration>
      ...
      <pluginDependencies>
          <pluginDependency>
              <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
          </pluginDependency>
      </pluginDependencies>
      ...
      <instructions>
        ...
        <Require-Bundle>
          ...
          fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill;resolution:="optional",
          ...
        </Require-Bundle>
        <Import-Package>
          ...
          fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill;resolution:="optional",
          ...
        </Import-Package>
        ...
      </instructions>
      ...
    </configuration>
    ...
  </plugin>
  ...
</plugins>
```

### Generate a WRM context with the client-side "host" application

Whenever the Atlassian Connect Polyfill generates the iframe, it also needs to load a client-side "host" application.

#### Add the @collabsoft-net/connect package

The first step is to add the `@collabsoft-net/connect` package to your `package.json`.
You can read how to install the package in [the package readme](https://github.com/collabsoft-net/iapetus/blob/main/packages/connect/README.md#im-feeling-lucky)

#### Add an entrypoint specifically for Atlassian Connect

```
try {
  // Uncomment this line if you want a "general pages" experience (it removes the footer)
  // document.documentElement.classList.add('page-type-connect');

  // We need to make sure we only initialize AC polyfill once
  // After initialisation, the AC object is placed on the window object
  // If it's already there, don't bother, otherwise go for it!
  // Make sure to use a app-specific name, to avoid collision with other apps
  if (!window.MyAppHost) {
    window.MyAppHost = new Host({
      // appKey:
      // product: 'jira'|'confluence
      // baseUrl: The URL to your servlet, see below
      // xdm_e: the base URL of the jira instance (incl. contextpath)
      // contextPath: the contextpath of the host application
      // license: the state of the license. This is also available as meta tag (name="${appKey}-lic")
      // navigator: a list of paths for the `addonModule` option in AP.navigator.go()
      // dialogs: a list of paths & options for dialogs based on dialog key
      // editors: a list of paths & options for confluence macro editors
      // verbose: true|false (for debugging)
    });
    window.MyAppHost.init();
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error('[AC] Failed to initialize Atlassian Connect polyfill', err);
}
```

This code will have to be added to a `<web-resource />` [module](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/web-resource-module/) 
which can be included in the page using a specific `<context />`. An example would be:


```
<atlassian-plugin ...>
  ...
  <web-resource key="atlassian-connect-polyfill" ...>
    <context>atlassian-connect-polyfill</context>
    ...
  </web-resource>
  ...
</atlassian-plugin>
```

In addition, you will need to set the `ac.context` parameter in the `plugin-info` section of the `atlassian-plugin.xml`:

```
<atlassian-plugin ...>
  ...
  <plugin-info>
    ...
    <!-- Atlassian Connect -->
    <param name="ac.context">atlassian-connect-polyfill</param>
    ...
  </plugin-info>
  ...
</atlassian-plugin>
```

### Create a servlet that will serve your HTML

In an Atlassian Connect descriptor for Cloud apps, there is a `baseUrl` property that needs to be set.
For Atlassian Connect Polyfill, this is equally required. But instead of an external URL, it needs to be
served from the Atlassian host application.

In this example, we will be adding a Servlet which will serve HTML and will include a web resource through a context.
This is basically the setup for a Single Page Application type of architecture, in which the logic is all done client-side.

You can of course change the Servlet and use server-side rendering, for instance using velocity templates. That's all up to you.

In the `atlassian-plugin.xml` add:

```
<atlassian-plugin ...>
  ...
  <plugin-info>
    ...
    <!-- Atlassian Connect -->
    <param name="ac.baseurl">/plugins/servlet/path/to/servlet/</param>
    ...
  </plugin-info>
  ...
</atlassian-plugin>
```

Next we need to register the URL pattern for our servlet in the same `atlassian-plugin.xml`:

```
<atlassian-plugin ...>
  ...
  <servlet class="path.to.ACServlet" ...>
      <url-pattern>/path/to/servlet/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet>
  ...
</atlassian-plugin>
```

And finally we add `<root>/src/main/path/to/ACServlet.java` with the following code:

```
public class ACServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private final WebResourceAssemblerFactory webResourceAssemblerFactory;
    private final UserManager userManager;
    private final UserThemeService userThemeService;

    ACServlet(@ComponentImport WebResourceAssemblerFactory webResourceAssemblerFactory, @ComponentImport UserManager userManager, @ComponentImport UserThemeService userThemeService) {
        this.webResourceAssemblerFactory = webResourceAssemblerFactory;
        this.userManager = userManager;
        this.userThemeService = userThemeService;
    }

  @Override
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
      resp.setContentType("text/html; charset=utf-8");

      try (PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter()) {
          String response = renderIframeContent(req);
          writer.write(response);
      } catch (Exception exp) {
          resp.sendError(500, exp.toString());
      }
  }

  public String renderIframeContent(HttpServletRequest req)  throws IOException {
      HtmlFragment resources = this.getResources();

      UserKey userKey = this.userManager.getRemoteUserKey();
      String colorMode = null != userKey ? this.userThemeService.getColorMode(userKey) : "LIGHT";

      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
      sb.append("<!doctype html>");
      sb.append(String.format("<html lang=\"en\" data-color-mode=\"%s\" data-theme=\"dark:dark light:light spacing:spacing\">", colorMode.toLowerCase()));
      sb.append("<head>");
      sb.append("<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">");
      sb.append(new HtmlFragment(resources.toString()));
      sb.append("</head>");
      sb.append("<body>");
      sb.append("</body>");
      sb.append("</html>");
      return sb.toString();
  }

  private HtmlFragment getResources() throws IOException {
    Writer writer = new StringWriter();
    WebResourceAssembler assembler = this.webResourceAssemblerFactory.create().includeSyncbatchResources(false).includeSuperbatchResources(false).autoIncludeFrontendRuntime(false).build();
    assembler.resources().requireWebResource("com.atlassian.auiplugin:split_aui.page.design-tokens-base-themes-css");
    assembler.resources().requireContext(ResourcePhase.DEFER, "my-front-end-app-context");
    WebResourceSet resources = assembler.assembled().drainIncludedResources();
    resources.writeHtmlTags(writer, UrlMode.AUTO);

    writer.flush();
    return new HtmlFragment(writer.toString());
  }
}
```

### Adjust your `atlassian-plugin.xml` to start using the polyfill

The next step is to start directing traffic to the Atlassian Connect Polyfill by adjusting your
`atlassian-plugin.xml` and using the polyfill in modules.

The easiest implementation it the web-item module ([Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/web-item/) | [Confluence](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/web-item-plugin-module/))

Take for instance the following web item module:

```
<web-item key="my-web-item" ...>
  <label>My Web Item</label>
  <link>/plugins/servlet/atlassian-connect/${pluginKey}/my-web-item</link>
  <param name="decorator" value="atl.admin" />
  <param name="url" value="/my-web-item" />
</web-item>
```

This will add a link to the specified location which will redirect the user to the Atlassian Connect Polyfill.
The Atlassian Connect Polyfill will apply the decorator (incl. a WebSudo check for admin pages).

The `url` parameter is appended to the `ac.baseurl` which we provided earlier in the `plugin-info` section.
This allows us to differentiate between modules when we choose for server-side rendering. In addition it is
also possible to use client-side routing (i.e. react-router).

Please refer to the examples to see more implementations of modules using Atlassian Connect Polyfill.

### Add support for licensing (optional)

The Atlassian Connect Polyfill is a separate companion app that is installed in the host product. As such, it does
not have access to the license state of the app that is using the Atlassian Connect Polyfill to render the iframe.

In order to simulate Atlassian Connect, the Atlassian Connect Polyfill app does provide the `&lic=` query string
parameter. This will default to `&lic=none`, meaning that the license state is not passed to the client.

If you wish to enable proper support for the `&lic=` parameter, you will have to register the PluginLicenceManager
of your app with the Atlassian Connect Polyfill.

In order to do this, you will need to import the `PluginLicenseRepository` and the `PluginLicenseManager` using OSGi.

```
import com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.bridge.external.PluginRetrievalService;
import com.atlassian.upm.api.license.PluginLicenseManager;
import fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.PluginLicenseRepository;
...
@ComponentImport
private final PluginLicenseRepository pluginLicenseRepository;

@ComponentImport
private final PluginLicenseManager licenseManager;

@ComponentImport
private final PluginRetrievalService pluginRetrievalService;
...
```

To register the PluginLicenseManager, call the `register()` method:

```
Plugin plugin = pluginRetrievalService.getPlugin();
this.pluginLicenseRepository.register(plugin.getKey(), licenseManager);
```

Once the PluginLicenseManager is registered, the `&lic=` query string parameter will reflect your app license state.

### Add platform specific code (optional)

The Atlassian Connect Polyfill also comes with platform specific helpers. These are libraries that you can
use in your application just like any other 3rd party dependency.

#### Atlassian Jira

For Atlassian Jira, you can add the following dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>jira</classifier>
</dependency>
```

This exposes the `JiraContextProvider` and the `JiraUserThemeService` classes.

You can use the `JiraUserThemeService` to get the theme for a specific user.
Please note that theming is only supported in Jira 10+. For Jira 9, it will always return "LIGHT".

The `JiraContextProvider` can be used to render the iframe in any module that supports Velocity rendering
(i.e. the [Web Panel](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/web-panel-plugin-module/#application-specific-locations))

Example:

```
<web-panel key="my-issue-panel" location="atl.jira.view.issue.left.context">
    <label key="Issue Panel" />
    <context-provider class="fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.jira.JiraContextProvider">
        <param name="ac.plugin.key" value="${pluginKey}" />
        <param name="ac.moduleKey" value="my-issue-panel" />
        <param name="url" value="/my-issue-panel" />
    </context-provider>
    <resource name="view" type="velocity"><![CDATA[$ACHtml]]></resource>
</web-panel>
```

As you can see, the Web Panel uses an inline velocity template which renders the `$ACHtml`
property provided by the `JiraContextProvider`.

This will render the web panel correctly with an iframe and the client-side host application.

#### Atlassian Confluence

For Atlassian Confluence, you can add the following dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>confluence</classifier>
</dependency>
```

This exposes the `ConfluenceContextProvider`, `ConfluenceMacro` and the `ConfluenceUserThemeService` classes.

You can use the `ConfluenceUserThemeService` to get the theme for a specific user.
Please note that theming is only supported in Confluence 9+. For Confluence 8, it will always return "LIGHT".

The `ConfluenceContextProvider` can be used to render the iframe in any module that supports Velocity rendering 
(i.e. the [Web Panel](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/web-panel-plugin-module/#application-specific-locations))

Example:

```
<web-panel key="fyi-iapetus-examples-comments-panel" location="atl.comments.view.bottom" weight="10">
    <label key="Confluence Example" />
    <context-provider class="fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.confluence.ConfluenceContextProvider">
        <param name="ac.plugin.key" value="${atlassian.plugin.key}" />
        <param name="ac.moduleKey" value="fyi-iapetus-examples-comments-panel" />
        <param name="url" value="/atl.comments.view.bottom" />
    </context-provider>
    <resource name="view" type="velocity"><![CDATA[$ACHtml]]></resource>
</web-panel>
```

As you can see, the Web Panel uses an inline velocity template which renders the `$ACHtml`
property provided by the `ConfluenceContextProvider`.

This will render the web panel correctly with an iframe and the client-side host application.

The `ConfluenceMacro` class can be used to render the iframe in a macro.

Example:

```
<xhtml-macro name="confluence-example-macro" key="fyi-iapetus-examples-macro" class="fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.confluence.ConfluenceMacro">
    <param name="url" value="/macro" />

    <description key="Atlassian Connect Polyfill example macro" />
    <category name="external-content"/>
    <parameters>
        <parameter name="name" type="string" required="false" multiple="false" />
    </parameters>
</xhtml-macro>
```

This will render the macro correctly with an iframe and the client-side host application.

#### Atlassian Bamboo

For Atlassian Bamboo, you can add the following dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>bamboo</classifier>
</dependency>
```

This exposes the `BambooContextProvider` and the `BambooUserThemeService` classes.

You can use the `BambooUserThemeService` to get the theme for a specific user.
Please note that theming is only supported in Bamboo 10+. For Bamboo 9, it will always return "LIGHT".

The `BambooContextProvider` can be used to render the iframe in any module that supports Velocity rendering
(i.e. the [Web Panel](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/web-panel-plugin-module/#application-specific-locations))

Example:

```
<web-panel key="fyi-iapetus-examples-job-summary-panel" location="jobresult.summary.right">
    <context-provider class="fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.bamboo.BambooContextProvider">
        <param name="url" value="/job-summary-panel" />
    </context-provider>
    <resource name="view" type="velocity"><![CDATA[$ACHtml]]></resource>
</web-panel>
```

As you can see, the Web Panel uses an inline velocity template which renders the `$ACHtml`
property provided by the `BambooContextProvider`.

This will render the web panel correctly with an iframe and the client-side host application.

#### Atlassian Bitbucket

For Atlassian Bitbucket, you can add the following dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>fyi.iapetus.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>acpolyfill</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>bitbucket</classifier>
</dependency>
```

This exposes the `BitbucketContextProvider` and the `BitbucketUserThemeService` classes.

You can use the `BitbucketUserThemeService` to get the theme for a specific user.
Please note that theming is only supported in Bitbucket 9+. For Bitbucket 8, it will always return "LIGHT".

The `BitbucketContextProvider` can be used to render the iframe in any module that supports Velocity rendering
(i.e. the [Web Panel](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/web-panel-plugin-module/#application-specific-locations))

Example:

```
<web-panel key="fyi-iapetus-examples-project-overview-panel" location="bitbucket.web.project.overview.banner">
    <context-provider class="fyi.iapetus.plugins.acpolyfill.bitbucket.BitbucketContextProvider">
        <param name="url" value="/project-overview-panel" />
    </context-provider>
    <resource name="view" type="velocity"><![CDATA[$ACHtml]]></resource>
</web-panel>
```

As you can see, the Web Panel uses an inline velocity template which renders the `$ACHtml`
property provided by the `BitbucketContextProvider`.

This will render the web panel correctly with an iframe and the client-side host application.
